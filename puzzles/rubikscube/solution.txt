*** facts:

- center pieces are fix
- every piece has defined end position and rotation
- cube can be assembled wrong, then it can not be solved

*** algorithm:

1. solve down layer, don't care for middle and up layers
  1. solve 4 edges, preserve other edges
    1. move in other edge on f/b: ff u/U/uu ff
    2. rotate f/b edge: FruRff
  2. solve 4 corners, preserve edges and other corners
    1. bring in other corner on f/r/d: ruR
    2. rotate f/r/d corner: ruRUruR (repeat if necessary)
2. solve middle layer, preserve down layer
  1. solve 4 edges of middle layer, preserve other edges
    1. edge to solve (e1) faces u/r
    2. edge to swap with (e2) faces u/r
    3. make e2 having right color facing r with rbuBURu
    4. swap e1/e2: ruR UruuR UruuR UruR
3. solve up layer, preserve down and middle layers
  1. solve corners, preserve other corners
    1. put one corner in right position
    2. swap r/b and l/b corners with: RfruRUFur
    3. swap 2 corners until all in right place
    4. rotate r/f l/b corners: RDrd RDrd uu DRdr DRdr uu
    5. rotate 2 corners until all in right orientation
  2. solve edges, preserver everything else
    1. permute f, r and b edges: rrD RlffrLuu drr
    2. permute until all edges in right place
    3. rotate f and b edges with: buBU buBUR uu rbuBU buBUR uu lld RlffrLuu RlffrLuu Dll
    4. rotate all edges until all in right orientation

*** open questions:

- need algorithm to swap only two edges in up layer?
- need algorithm to rotate exactly one piece?
